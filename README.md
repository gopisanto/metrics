# Metrics

    This application displays D3 charts and Table based on the data.
    Data is of different units, so there is a split mode and non split mode.
    Split Mode:- Here it will groups the data by category and type and displays
    multiple tables and charts
    Non Split Mode:- It displays only one chart and table regardless of units.
    Small screen support:- It does not display both chart and table together,
    instead it displays Tabs to choose either table or chart.

## Instructions to run the application in development

- navigate to project root folder
- run command _npm i_ which installs all the dependencies
- now run the command _npm run dev_
- It will automatically open the browser, if not you can type the url http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Instructions to run the application in production

- navigate to project root folder
- run command _npm i_ which installs all dependencies
- now run _npm run build_ which will build the project and creates a build folder
- now run _npm start_ which uses _serve_ server which will serve the application at http://localhost:5000

## Technologies

- I have used ReactJS library, Typescript, D3 charts and react-icons.
- I have used _scss_ to style the components.

## Testing

- I have written unit test cases using _Jest_. Only helpers are tested, because of time limit.

## Deployment

- Finally it is deployed at http://view-metrics.herokuapp.com/

## Things to improve if more time.

- Make the code more re-usable though it is re-usable now.
- Since i am beginner for TypeScript and D3 charts, please expect some nominal coding standards.
- Feedback would help me to improve more.
- If some suggestions to implement or modify, please let me know so that i can work upon and get back to you.
